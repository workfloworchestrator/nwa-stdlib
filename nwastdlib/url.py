class URL(str):
    r"""Helper class for conveniently constructing URLs.

    To that end the `/` operator has been overloaded to append path elements. Similarly the `//` operator has
    been overloaded to easily add a query string to the URL.

    Being a subclass of `str`, instances of `URL` can be used anywhere a `str` is expected.

    *IMPORTANT* No form of verification is performed. Meaning for instance that any string, not only those that
    actually make up an URL, can be use to initialize an URL instance. And one can add multiple query strings to an
    URL instance leading to an improperly formatted URL.

    Example::
            >>> base_url = URL("http://example.org/")

            >>> str(base_url)
            'http://example.org/'
            >>> repr(base_url)
            "URL('http://example.org/')"

            >>> base_url / "/api"  == base_url / "api"
            True

            >>> api_url = base_url / "api"
            >>> str(api_url)
            'http://example.org/api'

            >>> url = api_url / "ip" / "address" // {"version": 4}
            >>> str(url)
            'http://example.org/api/ip/address?version=4'

            >>> # paths don't need to be strings
            >>> url = api_url / 1 / 2 / 3
            >>> str(url)
            'http://example.org/api/1/2/3'

            >>> # query string properly url encoded?
            >>> url = api_url // {"query": ' "%-.<>\\^_`{|}~'}
            >>> str(url)
            'http://example.org/api?query=+%22%25-.%3C%3E%5C%5E_%60%7B%7C%7D~'
